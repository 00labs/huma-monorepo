# Transparency Board - Key Addresses

Huma Protocol strives to operate at the highest level of transparency. We commit to abide by the following principles:

- The ownership of Huma Config, which can change the protocol configurations, to be a timelock.
- The ownership of each of the pool contracts in production to be timelocks.
- The proposer of all the timelock to be a multisig with majority votes from at least 3 signees.
- The duration between proposal approval and execution is at least 48 hours.
- All the key addresses (timelock address, multisig address, and multisig signees) for the protocol and all pools in production are published on this page.
